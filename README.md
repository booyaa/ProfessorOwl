# Professor Owl Teaches Docker!

This is a new, fun way to learn to use Docker without needing a server in the 
cloud or installing Docker Toolbox on your computer. All you need is a modern 
web browser! 

Our highly advanced "Professional Online Wow Learning software" &trade; 
(Professor Owl) will guide you through setting up your first container, 
managing and troubleshooting.

You’ll also learn how to:
- set up a data volume
- link containers
- make ports visible on the Internet
- deploy your first web app
- combine containers to host your own blog

By the end of the tutorial you’ll see how easy it is to run Docker.

# Progress / Status: Active

A proof of concept demo has been created. In the demo the Prof runs the 
[hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world) container and then 
invites the student to try for themselves. The purpose of the proof of 
concept was to show that the student's terminal could be set to read-only and 
toggle as and when required during the training session.

The demo site isn't ready for prime time, so we've uploaded our proof of 
concept demo to [youtube](https://youtu.be/W4i7fzvy38U)!
